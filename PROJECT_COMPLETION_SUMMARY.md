---

## 📊 WHAT WAS COMPLETED TODAY

### ✅ 1. Frontend Folder Structure Reorganization

**Created Proper Component Architecture:**
```
frontend/src/
├── components/          (Reusable components)
│   ├── Header.jsx       (Navigation header with JSDoc)
│   └── Footer.jsx       (Page footer with JSDoc)
│
├── pages/               (Page-level components)
│   ├── HomePage.jsx     (Landing page - URL input placeholder)
│   └── ResultsPage.jsx  (Results display - Output placeholder)
│
├── services/            (API and business services)
│   └── apiClient.js     (Axios HTTP client - Environment-aware)
│
├── App.jsx              (Root component)
├── main.jsx             (React entry point)
└── index.css            (Global styles)
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns (components, pages, services)
- ✅ Reusable Header and Footer components
- ✅ HomePage and ResultsPage with placeholder content
- ✅ Environment-aware Axios client in services folder
- ✅ All components include comprehensive JSDoc comments
- ✅ Scalable structure ready for feature addition

### ✅ 2. Backend Configuration Enhancement

**Added Python Runtime Specification:**
- Created `backend/runtime.txt` with Python 3.10.13
- Ensures consistent Python version across all deployment platforms
- Required for Heroku, Railway, and other PaaS platforms

**Project Structure Complete:**
```
backend/
├── app/
│   ├── main.py          (FastAPI app + CORS + health checks)
│   ├── config.py        (Pydantic settings management)
│   ├── wsgi.py          (Production WSGI entry point)
│   ├── routes/          (Ready for Phase 6+)
│   ├── services/        (Ready for Phase 6+)
│   ├── schemas/         (Ready for Phase 6+)
│   └── utils/           (Ready for Phase 6+)
├── requirements.txt
├── requirements-prod.txt
├── runtime.txt          (✅ NEW)
└── [deployment configs]
```
